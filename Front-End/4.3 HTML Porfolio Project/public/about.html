<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Bethelhem Melese Habte. I am a second-year Computer Science student 
  at the American University of Ras Al Khaimah (AURAK). My journey into the world
   of technology began after a stint in the medical field, where I studied at St. Paul 
   Millennium Medical College in Ethiopia. My academic achievements earned me a merit-based scholarship,
   which enabled me to transition to AURAK and pursue my passion for computer science.</p>

<p>I have a strong enthusiasm for web development, artificial intelligence (AI),
   and machine learning (ML). These fields captivate me with their potential to 
   revolutionize industries and improve lives. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge
    and skills in these areas, aiming to contribute to innovative projects and solutions.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing football and hiking. These activities 
  not only keep me physically active but also help me maintain a balanced lifestyle.
  At 21 years old, I am eager to continue my educational journey and make meaningful 
  contributions to the tech industry. My background in medicine and current focus on 
  computer science uniquely positions me to bridge the gap between these two fields, 
  driving advancements that benefit both.</p>
